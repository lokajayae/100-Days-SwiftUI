# Day 1: First Step in Swift

## Why Swift (2014)?
1. Hard to write unsafe code
2. Easy to write code thats clear and understandable
3. Support all language out of the box

## Variable
Variable is a way to store named data that can change at runtime.
```swift
var name = "Ted"
```

## Constant
Constant is a way to store named data that can't change at runtime
```swift
let phi = 3.14
```

## Type Safe
Swift is a type-safe language meaning that once you declared a variable as String or Integer. You cant assign value with different data type from the initial assignment.
